# Gno.land Platform Raffle Competition

Welcome to our Gnolang platform raffle, designed to put our platform to the test!
This competition is a unique blend of two main areas:

1. **Chess Mastery (50% of Points)**:
Dive into the strategic world of chess, whether you're a grandmaster or a beginner.
Every game, every win, and every move you make offers you points.

3. **Platform Engagement (50% of Points)**:
Outside the chessboard, we invite you to engage with our blockchain, craft integrations, report bugs, and more.
This segment isn't just for developers; it's for anyone willing to explore and contribute.

Our intent is clear: everyone should have a fair shot at winning.
This isn't just about expertise in one domain; it's about passion, exploration, and collaboration.
While we've worked hard on this, please remember, this is an experimental phase, and there might be hiccups along the way.
We apologize in advance for any bugs you might encounter and truly appreciate your patience and resilience. 

Join us on this adventure! We eagerly await the discussions, feedback, and innovations that will stem from this competition.
