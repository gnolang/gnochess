GnoChess is an implementation of an online chess server with Gno. It is used to
showcase Gno's capabilities for developing semi-complex dApps. It comes with a
frontend and a faucet for ease of participation, and the backend and frontend
implement many features commonly found in chess servers (full ruleset
implementation, leaderboards, time controls, Glicko2 ratings).

This repository hosts both the source code for the [GnoChess realm and
website](https://gnochess.com), as well as a dedicted tutorial section,
originally planned to accompany a talk for Gophercon 2023.

You can learn how to make a Gno chess server yourself by following the guides
in the `tutorial` section (at the time of writing, still being developed!).
The tutorials are designed to be performed in a GitPod workspace. By clicking
the above button, you can access GitPod and start hacking straight away!

After you've done that, click here to jump to the
