GnoChess is an implementation of an online chess server with Gno. It is used to
showcase Gno's capabilities for developing semi-complex dApps. It comes with a
frontend and a faucet for ease of participation, and the backend and frontend
implement many features commonly found in chess servers (full ruleset
implementation, leaderboards, time controls, Glicko2 ratings).

You can learn how to make this yourself by following the guides in the
`tutorial` section (at the time of writing, still being developed!).
The tutorials are designed to be performed in a GitPod workspace. By clicking
the above button, you can access GitPod and start hacking straight away!
